# Asteroids

**Asteroids** is a classic arcade-style game clone built using Python and the Pygame library. This project was developed as part of a guided course on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev), designed to deepen understanding of game development fundamentals, Python programming, and software design principles.

## About the Game

Navigate your spaceship, avoid or destroy incoming asteroids, and rack up points! The game features:

- Smooth player controls with rotation and movement.
- Dynamic asteroid spawning and splitting mechanics.
- Score tracking and display.
- Simple yet expandable game architecture using object-oriented programming.

## What I Learned

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

- **Python OOP:** Designing reusable game entities like Player, Asteroid, and Shots as classes with inheritance.
- **Pygame library:** Managing game loop, sprites, rendering, input handling, and collision detection.
- **Game mechanics:** Implementing physics-like velocity, rotation, and collision splitting.
- **Code organization:** Structuring code across multiple modules, managing imports, and maintaining readability.
- **Code quality tools:** Applying PEP 8 style conventions and using Flake8 for linting.
- **Documentation:** Writing clear docstrings to improve maintainability and collaboration readiness.
- **Version control:** Linking commits and branches to GitHub issues to practice collaborative workflows.
